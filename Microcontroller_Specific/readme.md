In the driver specific header file we need to define 3 structures namely Register, Configuration and Handler.Register structure contains contains the registers specific to that driver.For example UART register contains  32 bit Status register,data register ,baud rate register and 3 control registers.We should not miss any register as size of register structure is determined by length of each register.Configuration structure contains the mode in which peripheral is being used.For Eg, in UART  requires configurations like which uart peripheral is used, duplexity, no. of stop bits, baud rate, parity control, hardware flow control.Last but not the least,Handler structure,this mainly contains register structure type pointer and configuration structure type pointer. We also need to declare the APIs for initializing, deintializing, sendData API and receive data API. These are the four basic API which we need to define in driver source to facilitate the communication.
